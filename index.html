          <h1>Welcome to SCCM Child Care</h1>
          <div>

            <p class="hmp">
              At SCCM Child Care our goal is to provide a safe, caring, and fun environment where your child can learn, play,
              and grow. We understand that each child has unique talents, learning styles, and personalities. Here you will find a safe
              & nurturing environment for children of all ages.<br><br>
              While enrolled at SCCM Child Care your child will participate in developmentally-appropriate activities, such as:
              <b>Preschool Curriculum, Field Trips, Outside Play, Story Time, Sand & Water Play, Fun Fridays, Arts and Crafts, Music and
              Dance, and much more...</b><br><br>
              At SCCM Family Child Care we feel it is important for parents to know how their child spent the day. Each day your child
              will take home a "What I Did Today" sheet. We provide healthy meals and snacks for each child. We also send home monthly
              newsletters which keep parents informed about curriculum, field trips, and other fun activites.<br><br>
              We are licensed as a large family child care home.<br>
              We meet and exceed all health and safety guidelines.<br><br>
              <b>Thank you for taking the time to visit our site and for your interest in SCCM Child Care.</b>
